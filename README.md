Gameboy Music Player
This is a music player I have decided to build for the original Gameboy using C. This is very rough, but I will update this as time goes on. The main program is main.c, and the main.gb file can be run on emulators such as Visual Boy Advance or Free Emu. 

Note: you will need to download GBDK and make sure gb.h is properly included in your path.

This project has come to a standstill for now.
